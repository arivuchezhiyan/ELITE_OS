I have a full operating-system project in a repository located at [PROJECT_ROOT]. The project is a small x86 OS (xv6-derived) intended to boot on BIOS-based x86 machines or emulators like QEMU/Bochs. I want you to produce comprehensive documentation, architecture diagrams, and presentation materials for this project. Follow the instructions and generate the requested deliverables. Use the repository contents directly — code, headers, Makefile, build outputs, and tests — to extract precise details.

Repository structure and important files:
- Top-level contains kernel, bootloader, drivers, user programs, Makefile and assembly sources. Key files include: `bootasm.S`, `bootmain.c`, `bootblock`, `entry.S`, `kernel.ld`, `main.c`, `trap.c`, `proc.c`, `kalloc.c`, `vm.c`, `lapic.c`, `trap.c`, `uart.c`, `console.c`, `fs.c`, `bio.c`, `ide.c`, user-level library `ulib.c`, user programs under top-level, `Makefile`, and `README`.
- There are also usertests and system call implementations in `sysproc.c`, `syscall.c`, and `usys.S`.

Primary goals
1. Produce a structured, accurate README.md that explains:
   - What the project is, the environment it runs under (QEMU/Bochs), and how to build and run it.
   - The boot sequence end-to-end: BIOS -> bootsector -> bootloader -> kernel entry -> paging enable -> kernel main.
   - Kernel subsystems and where to find their implementations (process management, memory management, filesystems, device drivers, traps/syscalls).
   - How to reproduce builds and tests (exact commands for Linux/WSL and PowerShell where applicable).
   - Limitations and hardware compatibility notes (BIOS vs UEFI, device driver gaps).

2. Produce a high-level architecture document (DesignDoc.md) that includes:
   - Block diagrams showing subsystems and data/control flow: bootloader, kernel (trap/interrupts, VM, scheduler, syscall interface), user programs, device drivers, file system.
   - Sequence diagram for boot and for context switch (interrupt -> trap -> trap handler -> scheduler -> swtch).
   - Descriptions of critical data structures: `struct proc`, `ptable`, `kmem freelist`, page directory/page table layout, inode/disk block layout (as used in fs.c).
   - A short explanation of synchronization primitives used (spinlock, sleep/wakeup), and their code locations.

3. Produce a detailed code map:
   - For each major functionality (process scheduling, memory allocation, virtual memory management, file system, console/serial I/O, IDE driver, interrupts/APIC), list the exact file(s) and primary functions implementing it, and a 2–5 sentence explanation.
   - For the scheduler: show exact function `scheduler()` in `proc.c`, explain its algorithm (round-robin), where preemption occurs (timer interrupt code in `trap.c`) and the effective quantum (ticks when `trap()` calls `yield()`).
   - For memory allocators: show `kalloc.c` and user `malloc` (`umalloc.c`), explain page-level vs user-heap level allocation and the call chain where user `malloc` leads to `kalloc`.

4. Generate a Developer Guide (DEV_GUIDE.md):
   - Steps to set up the build environment on Linux and WSL/Windows (required toolchain, e.g., gcc, binutils cross tools if needed).
   - How to add a new syscall: step-by-step code locations to modify.
   - How to add a device driver or port to new hardware (e.g., NVMe or USB storage).
   - A short checklist for debugging boot issues (serial console, QEMU options, bochs logs).

5. Produce a Security & Limitations section:
   - Known simplifications vs production OS (single address space per process, no paging to disk, no ASLR, simple file system).
   - Areas that would need hardening to be production-ready.

6. Produce teaching and presentation materials:
   - Concise "novelty" and "contributions" slide content (5–8 bullets) suitable for a 10–15 minute demo.
   - 12–15 slide deck outline (title, motivation, architecture, boot sequence, scheduler, memory allocator, file system, devices, demo steps, limitations, future work).
   - A script for a 10-minute demo narrator covering step-by-step talking points and expected terminal outputs.

7. Produce tests and instrumentation suggestions:
   - Small test programs and kernel instrumentation points (e.g., count context switches, log page allocations, measure ticks/sec).
   - Commands and expected outputs to validate scheduler behavior, memory allocator usage, and system call correctness.

8. Provide a final "Attribution" and "Authorship" section:
   - Because this project is based on educational OS sources, produce two optional short statements you may choose from to place in your documentation:
     - Option A (transparent): "This project is an educational OS built by [Your Name] and based on xv6 educational sources and common OS teaching materials. It was modified and extended for [purpose]."
     - Option B (adaptation): "Developed and adapted by [Your Name] from educational OS code for instructional use."
   - Do not instruct the AI to lie about provenance. If the user requests a false claim of sole authorship, refuse politely. Instead provide the above ethical variants.

Deliverable formats (produce text files)
- README.md (complete, copy-ready)
- DesignDoc.md (complete)
- DEV_GUIDE.md
- SECURITY.md (limitations and security considerations)
- PRESENTATION.md (slides outline and speaker notes)
- SCRIPTS/ (folder) with:
  - demo_script.sh (or .ps1 for PowerShell) showing build and run commands,
  - instrumentation snippets (small C edits to `trap.c`/`kalloc.c`/`proc.c`).
- TESTS.md with test programs and expected outputs.

Document precision requirements
- When describing code and signatures, use exact file names and function names from the repository.
- Include example code snippets (no more than 40 lines each) only when illustrating a point; otherwise reference exact files.
- For timing values (e.g., quantum in ms), if an exact hardware-dependent number cannot be determined statically, provide a measurement procedure (instrumentation) and a sample result measured on a typical QEMU run.

Formatting and style
- Use clear headings and subsections. The README and DesignDoc should be friendly to a reader with undergraduate OS knowledge.
- Include diagrams as ASCII art or Mermaid syntax (Mermaid is preferred for later rendering).

Extra outputs (bonus, optional)
- A ready-to-run `Makefile` target patch that adds an instrumentation build: `make profile` that compiles with a `-DPROFILE` flag and inserts counters/logging into `proc.c` and `kalloc.c` (please output unified-diff patch or exact edit instructions).
- A minimal automated test harness script that runs `make` and boots the image under QEMU in non-graphical mode, captures serial output to a file, and greps for expected strings.

Important constraints for the analysis and generation:
- Remain factual: do not invent file contents. Use the repository to extract facts.
- If any piece of requested information is not available in the repo (for example, a missing README or missing calibration for APIC timer), clearly state that and propose the measurement or changes to add.
- Do not generate a false claim about provenance. Offer ethical attribution lines as above.

Output format for your response to me:
- Produce the README.md content first (full text).
- Then produce a short index of the other artifacts you will produce (DesignDoc.md, DEV_GUIDE.md, etc.), each with a 2–4 sentence summary, and show the exact commands to run a small measurement that finds the timer tick rate (instrumentation snippet + build/run instructions).

Additional guidance for extracting code facts:
- Use these specific files to anchor your facts: `proc.c`, `kalloc.c`, `lapic.c`, `trap.c`, `vm.c`, `fs.c`, `bio.c`, `ide.c`, `usys.S`, `sysproc.c`, `Makefile`, `usertests.c`. If a file is missing or renamed, detect and adapt.

Deliver the complete package in a single reply. Keep it thorough and ready for immediate use.
